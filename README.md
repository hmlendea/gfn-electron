# Building from source

## Requirements

You will need to install [bun](https://bun.sh/), a faster and better alternative to the Node.js package manager.

## Cloning the source code

Once you have bun, clone the wrapper to a convenient location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmlendea/gfn-electron.git
```

## Building

```bash
bun install
bun start
```

On subsequent runs, `bun start` will be all that's required.

## Updating the source code

Simply pull the latest version of master and install any changed dependencies:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull
bun install
```
